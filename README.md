# Ask my PDF

Thank you for your interest in my application. Please be aware that this is only a **Proof of Concept system** and may contain bugs or unfinished features. 

Disclaimer: I gave full credits to [mobarski](https://github.com/mobarski/ask-my-pdf). He was the one created the initial repository. I just cloned his repo and ran the code. 

### Ask my PDF - Question answering system built on top of GPT3

üé≤ The primary use case for this app is to assist users in answering  questions about board game rules based on the instruction manual. While  the app can be used for other tasks, helping users with board game rules is particularly meaningful to me since I'm an avid fan of board games  myself. Additionally, this use case is relatively harmless, even in  cases where the model may experience hallucinations.

üåê The app can be accessed on the Streamlit Community Cloud at https://ask-my-pdf.streamlit.app/. üîë However, to use the app, you will need your own [OpenAI's API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

üìÑ The app implements the following academic papers:

- [In-Context Retrieval-Augmented Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00083) aka **RALM**
- [Precise Zero-Shot Dense Retrieval without Relevance Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10496) aka **HyDE** (Hypothetical Document Embeddings)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo:

   `git clone https://github.com/mobarski/ask-my-pdf`

2. Install dependencies:

   `pip install -r ask-my-pdf/requirements.txt`

3. Run the app:

   `cd ask-my-pdf/src`
   
   `run.sh` or `run.bat`
